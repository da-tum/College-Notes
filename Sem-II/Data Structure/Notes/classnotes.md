# Class Notes

## ADT --> Abstract Data Type 

### Definition

### Example

---

## Stack ADT (Abstract Data type)

### Details

1. Overflow
2. Push
3. Underflow
4. Pop
5. Peek

---

## Time Complexity

```py
Insert -> Add element to nay index of the given data. thus generally has O(N) time complexity.
Push -> Add element at top of the stack. thus generally has O(1) time complexity.

```

### To Focus on

1. Comparison
2. Shifting Or Movement of elements
3. Iterations -> looping time
4. Recursion -> how many times fucntion is calling itself.

---

## Differnce Between Loops (For,While,Do-While)

## Difference between if-else , nested if , nested if-else and its possibilities

## Difference between Iteration and Recursion

## OOPS

Class is basically a blueprint, a group of Objects.
In an object the defined variables in class must be present but not neccessarily used 
also we can add others as well, are not limited.
Objects are 'Insantiated' from the class.

### Constructor

Constructor is like a contrain that will automatically pass on their values in the object when created.>>> (TO CHECK)
__init__ ---> special function that runs when an object is created.
